<h2>Ani Nancy K.</h2>
<p>
    I am from Enugu state, Nigeria. I ventured into the tech world through the ALtSchool training 
    with the zeal to contribute to the myriad of people who have gone ahead of me in creating a link between medicine and tech. 
    With the level of tech inclination in the world today, I'm certain that the health care system will thrive even more profoundly on the thread of tech formation
    and I hope to apply the knowledge from this training as my own unwavery support in seeing that our health care system becomes a power tech system.
</p>

<p> Having been on this training for a month now, I can say that it has been a worth while experience. Sliding from a point of no knowledge whatsoever about the basic working system in tech to being aware of various structures that make up the tech system using languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript and the rest and it even gets better; cause now I am thrilled to point out the euphoria I get each time I see how well I could applied those knowledge in creating a space for myself through the GitHub space</p>
